His data are combined with ocean color measurements from satellites like PACE and models of ocean circulation. The goal of this effort is to predict the presence of domoic acid, a toxin produced by certain types of phytoplankton (Pseudo-nitzschia).

By forecasting toxin levels, the mussel industry can ensure food safety and protect public health.",
    "senior": "Bernard Friedman, colloquially known as the \"Mussel Man,\" routinely analyzes toxin levels in mussels cultivated at his aquaculture facility. His empirical data are integrated with ocean color measurements derived from satellites like PACE and ocean circulation models. The primary objective is to forecast the occurrence of domoic acid, a potent neurotoxin synthesized by certain diatom species, notably Pseudo-nitzschia. This toxin can bioaccumulate in shellfish tissues, posing severe health hazards to mammals, including humans, upon consumption. By anticipating toxin proliferation, the aquaculture industry can implement proactive measures such as timely harvesting suspensions, thereby safeguarding food safety and public health while mitigating economic losses."
