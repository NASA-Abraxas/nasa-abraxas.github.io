    "junior": "PACE is NASA's Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem mission. It's a special project that's being developed right now and is planned to launch in 2024. PACE will help us continue and improve over 20 years of NASA's satellite observations of:\nGlobal ocean biology: Studying tiny plants and animals in the ocean.\nAerosols: Tiny particles floating in the air.\nClouds: Masses of tiny water droplets or ice crystals in the sky.",
    "intermediate": "PACE is NASA's Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem mission, currently in the design phase of mission development. It is scheduled to launch in 2024, extending and improving NASA's over 20-year record of satellite observations of global ocean biology, aerosols (tiny particles suspended in the atmosphere), and clouds.",
    "senior": "PACE stands for Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem mission, a cutting-edge initiative by NASA currently in the design phase of mission development. Scheduled for launch in 2024, PACE aims to extend and enhance NASA's over 20-year legacy of satellite observations concerning global ocean biology, aerosols (microscopic particles suspended in the atmosphere), and cloud dynamics."
