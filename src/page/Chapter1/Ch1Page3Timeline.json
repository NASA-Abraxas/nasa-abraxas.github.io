      "senior": "The Ocean Color Instrument (OCI) aboard PACE offers a significantly enhanced perspective compared to the existing VIIRS sensor, which captures data at merely five visible bands. While VIIRS data can differentiate Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) conditions in a rudimentary manner—depicting HABs in red and non-HABs in black—PACE's OCI provides a sophisticated and comprehensive spectral representation. The hyperspectral capabilities of OCI enable the detection of subtle variations in ocean color, thereby refining the identification and analysis of phytoplankton communities, water quality parameters, and the early detection of HABs. This augmented spectral resolution facilitates more precise monitoring and analysis, underpinning improved management of marine resources and bolstering environmental conservation efforts."
